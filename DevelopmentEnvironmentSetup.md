# Development Environment #

This project template should work on any system that has its dependencies (Boost C++ Libraries, Qt4 SDK, Log4Cxx, and UnitTest++) properly installed and configured. That said, differences between development environments can lead to unexpected or unusual failures. When using the C++ Project Template, we recommend that you setup your environment using the directions at the following links:
